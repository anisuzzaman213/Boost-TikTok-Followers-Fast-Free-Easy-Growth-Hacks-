Avoid random numbers or underscores (e.g., @User_1234).

Write a Bio That Converts

Could you explain what you do in 1-2 sentences?

Use emojis to save space. Example: “🌍 Travel tips ✈️ Budget hacks 🔥 Follow for daily inspo!”

Add a clear CTA: “Follow for more!” or “Join the fun!”

Choose a Standout Profile Photo

Use a bright, high-resolution image of your face or brand logo.

Avoid cluttered backgrounds.

Add a Click-Worthy Link

Link to your Instagram, YouTube, or website.

Use free tools like Linktree or Taplink for multiple links.

Create Viral-Worthy Content
Content is king on TikTok. Here’s how to make it queen!

Use Trending Sounds

Check the “Discover” page daily for popular sounds.

Trending audio boosts visibility. Example: Use a viral song for your dance video.

Hashtags Are Your Best Friend

Mix 3-5 niche and general hashtags.

Examples: #TikTokTips (general) + #CatLovers (niche).

Hook Viewers in Seconds

Start with a bold statement: “Stop scrolling! This hack will save you $100!”

Use text overlays or jump cuts to grab attention.

Post Consistently

Aim for 1-3 posts daily.

Schedule posts during peak hours (7–9 AM, 12–2 PM, or 7–11 PM).

Collaborate with Duets/Stitches

React to popular videos using the “Duet” feature.

Example: Stitch a cooking video and add your recipe twist.
